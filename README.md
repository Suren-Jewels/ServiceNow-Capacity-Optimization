## 📈 Capacity Engineering Workflow

1. Collect system metrics (CPU, RAM, I/O, disk, network)
2. Normalize and aggregate data across 1,000+ nodes
3. Identify hotspots, saturation points, and underutilized resources
4. Build capacity models and forecast future demand
5. Recommend scaling actions (vertical, horizontal, or workload redistribution)
6. Validate improvements through load testing and telemetry
7. Document findings and present to engineering leadership
