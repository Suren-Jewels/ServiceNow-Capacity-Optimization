# 📊 ServiceNow Capacity Optimization Framework

**Automated analytics, forecasting, and operational insights for mission‑critical ServiceNow environments**

A sanitized engineering toolkit demonstrating API automation, capacity forecasting, and cross‑platform operational workflows.

---

## ✨ Overview  
This project delivers an automated pipeline for collecting, normalizing, and forecasting ServiceNow platform capacity metrics. It provides engineers and platform owners with actionable insights into node performance, workflow execution, and saturation risks across enterprise environments.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

- Explore [`architecture/`](architecture/) for system diagrams, workflow routing, and identity flow breakdowns  
- See [`docs/`](docs/) for ServiceNow catalog flows, troubleshooting, deployment notes, and data dictionary  
- Review [`scripts/`](scripts/) for automation supporting request flows, identity validation, and audit extraction  
- Check [`config/`](config/) for sanitized templates covering routing logic, posture baselines, and access policy definitions

---

## 🧾 System Summary  
The toolkit integrates with ServiceNow APIs to extract performance data, applies normalization rules for consistency, and generates capacity forecasts using lightweight analytics. It supports multi‑environment profiles, cross‑platform automation (Python + PowerShell), and modular configuration for enterprise deployments.

---

## 💡 Why This Work Matters  
ServiceNow performance directly impacts workflow execution, incident resolution, and enterprise productivity.  
This toolkit enables:

- Early detection of saturation risks  
- Data‑driven scaling decisions  
- Predictable platform performance  
- Improved user experience  
- Repeatable, auditable capacity workflows  

---

## 🎯 Responsibilities & Scope  
This repository demonstrates engineering capabilities across:

- API integration and automation  
- Data collection and normalization  
- Capacity forecasting and analytics  
- Cross‑platform scripting (Python + PowerShell)
